I just purchased an Elgato Stream Deck (15 keys). a Stream Deck is often used by people who stream content on YouTube or Twitch. But I'm not a streamer, then why I bought this device in the first place?

Stream Deck is used by streamer to easily control their streaming content such as keys toggle actions to start and stop streams, activate stream effects and other such actions. This can also be used as control center for you PC so I'll try to play around and do some fun (and lazy) stuffs with this.

Let's talk about the buttons first. Each button is LCD key where you can set design for each by uploading the images you want to assign on it. This LCD keys do other stuffs such as...

* The icon on a key could change dynamically based on state
* Keys could be fully animated to show something like a clock or timer in real time

The software could also be designed so that people can write their own plugins and controls for integration with other software (e.g. Slack, Coding snippets, macros, etc.)

There are also other open source projects out there for controlling a [](https://timothycrosley.github.io/streamdeck-ui/)specific app with stream deck. Such as Spotify, Discord, screen capture apps, etc.

## Sample Functions

So what does it really do and how do I use it?

With the stream deck, a key can be assign to have 2 main function.

* **Control**, execute the commands upon press
* **Deck**, press to open new sets of keys (something like folder within the device)

A ***control*** represents the most basic element that can be displayed in a Stream Deck.

The button on red box is an example of control key where I can toggle to mute/unmute mic in Discord application.

A ***deck*** is indented to deal with either of the following scenarios:

* Needing to display more controls than the device has physical keys for
* Showing a subset of relevant controls.

Here is sample of my **Deck** key where I put all my commands to control my music playback.

Here's what's inside that key. 

### PLUGINS

There are several open source plugin to improve the device compatibility with popular applications like Spotify, Discord, Slack, etc. And this device is also great to use with IFTTT!

## Summary

I've found the Stream Deck has been a great addition to my home office setup. I could switch between my preferred workspace in just 1 press of the button (with the help of advance launch plugin, we can setup chains of control commands on 1 button, great!). Monitor the status of my pc, or link with IoT device such as smart temperature and show the readings on one of the keys.

One of the things that I've enjoyed about using the Stream Deck is that it has made Voice chat in gaming much easier and smoother for me, and control playlists without minimizing the programs I'm using at that time. Regardless of whatever software we happen to be using at the time I can immediately mute or un-mute my microphone from the Stream Deck, as the Stream Deck mutes the microphone at the operating system level. I never have to find the mute button which can be a challenge if you have a lot of opened software and saves your time scrolling, sweeping, or switching on each of those.

tl;dr – Stream Deck will be useful outside streaming as well!

For next, I would like to try this with IFTTT and smart home device/appliances!
