I just purchased an Elgato Stream Deck (15 keys). a Stream Deck is often used by people who stream content on YouTube or Twitch. But I'm not a streamer, then why I bought this device in the first place?

Stream Deck is used by streamer to easily control their streaming content such as keys toggle actions to start and stop streams, activate stream effects and other such actions. This can also be used as control center for you PC so I'll try to play around and do some fun (and lazy) stuffs with this.

Let's talk about the buttons first. Each button is LCD key where you can set design for each by uploading the images you want to assign on it. This LCD keys do other stuffs such as...

* The icon on a key could change dynamically based on state
* Keys could be fully animated to show something like a clock or timer in real time

The software could also be designed so that people can write their own plugins and controls for integration with other software (e.g. Slack, Coding snippets, macros, etc.)

There are also other open source projects out there for controlling aÂ [](https://timothycrosley.github.io/streamdeck-ui/)specific app with stream deck. Such as Spotify, Discord, screen capture apps, etc.

## Sample Functions

So what does it really do and how do I use it?

With the stream deck, a key can be assign to have 2 main function.

- Control, execute the commands upon press
- Deck, press to open new sets of keys (something like folder within the device)

A control represents the most basic element that can be displayed in a Stream Deck.
